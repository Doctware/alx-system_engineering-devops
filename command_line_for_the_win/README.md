How the i implement SFTP in this task

first of all i navigate to my sand box on the intranet

then i copy my sftp address, it looks like -> 017a...5310f@017.....310f.d6..334f.alx-cod.online
then type the following command sftp [address] below is the example

sftp sftp 017a0975310f@017a0975310f.d64a334f.alx-cod.online
then i input the password then finally see the folowing propmt

sftp>

so i used the following command to upload my dirctory recursively, "put" 

sftp> put -r alx......sy.....devop/command.......
sftp>

while all the file for each task files is in the proper directory before 
uploading to the remote machine
